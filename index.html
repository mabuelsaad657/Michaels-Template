          My name is Michael Abuelsaad. I developed an interest in software engineering early in my freshman year of high school. Finding out about the countless entrepreneurial opportunities it could lead to, such as video game development, web development, robotics, etc., really sparked my interest in the field. I took classes in high school that covered the fundamentals needed to lay a solid foundation in the field, and I went on to major in Computer Science in college. Some of the relevant courses I took were Data Structures and Algorithms, Assembly Language, and Object-Oriented Programming. I wanted to expand my skill set, which led me to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through Code Academy and continue to use those skills to make web development projects with them. Every day I like learning something new and reflect on how I can use it to improve my skills. My hobbies outside of school are football, weightlifting, anime, and Apex Legends.
